# Cosmic Toolkit
Cosmic Toolkit is an opinionated toolkit to speed up the development of complex apps.

It's inspired by [Cosmic Python](https://www.cosmicpython.com/).

**Currently in alpha, so proceed with caution!**

## Example usage

There's a fairly complete example of how to use this package in
`./test/test_message_bus.py`.
